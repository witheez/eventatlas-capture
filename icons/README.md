# Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, if published)

## Temporary Workaround

Until proper icons are added, Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon.
You can create placeholder icons or use any PNG images with the correct names and sizes.

## Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Works well at small sizes
- Matches EventAtlas branding (amber/orange theme)
- Transparent background preferred
